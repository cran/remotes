\arguments{
\item{pkgdir}{path to a package directory, or to a package tarball.}

\item{dependencies}{Which dependencies do you want to check?
Can be a character vector (selecting from "Depends", "Imports",
"LinkingTo", "Suggests", or "Enhances"), or a logical vector.

\code{TRUE} is shorthand for "Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo" and
"Suggests". \code{NA} is shorthand for "Depends", "Imports" and "LinkingTo"
and is the default. \code{FALSE} is shorthand for no dependencies (i.e.
just check this package, not its dependencies).

The value "soft" means the same as \code{TRUE}, "hard" means the same as \code{NA}.

You can also specify dependencies from one or more additional fields,
common ones include:
\itemize{
\item Config/Needs/website - for dependencies used in building the pkgdown site.
\item Config/Needs/coverage for dependencies used in calculating test coverage.
}}

\item{repos}{A character vector giving repositories to use.}

\item{type}{Type of package to \code{update}.}

\item{upgrade}{One of "default", "ask", "always", or "never". "default"
respects the value of the \code{R_REMOTES_UPGRADE} environment variable if set,
and falls back to "ask" if unset. "ask" prompts the user for which out of
date packages to upgrade. For non-interactive sessions "ask" is equivalent
to "always". \code{TRUE} and \code{FALSE} are also accepted and correspond to
"always" and "never" respectively.}

\item{quiet}{If \code{TRUE}, suppress output.}

\item{build}{If \code{TRUE} build the package before installing.}

\item{build_opts}{Options to pass to \verb{R CMD build}, only used when \code{build}}

\item{build_manual}{If \code{FALSE}, don't build PDF manual ('--no-manual').}

\item{build_vignettes}{If \code{FALSE}, don't build package vignettes ('--no-build-vignettes').
is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link[utils:install.packages]{utils::install.packages()}}.}
